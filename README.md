## About
Hi, I am Eti-ini Umoh, a Pharmacist from the University of Benin, Nigeria. I am a data analyst and enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights and making data-driven decisions, especially in the healthcare sector. I have developed a unique blend of technical and soft skills necessary to drive insights from data. 

Throughout my learning journey, I have learnt to transform complex data into actionable insights and uncover  hidden patterns and trends. As an entry-level data analyst, I am ready to leverage my skills to solve problems with data.
